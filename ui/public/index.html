                    <p class="typographic-paragraph">
                        Chomp is a chat bot that specializes in explaining what computer science is and how to study it at the University of Florida. It can explain everything from what an “algorithm” is to how to enroll at UF to what specific classes and careers you can expect as a computer scientist.

                    <p class="typographic-paragraph">
                        Chomp was built using the open source <a href="https://rasa.com/">RASA project</a>.
                    </p>
					<p class="typographic-paragraph">
						RASA has an AI powered Natural Language Understanding system. This uses machine learning to analyze user input and try to match them to intents and extract topics. For example, when you ask Chomp “What is an algorithm?”, the NLU is what lets it recognize that is a “question” about the topic of “algorithms”.
                        Once RASA has made its best guess at the user’s intent and topic, it uses that information to look up an appropriate pre-written response. These pre-written responses are less interesting than the computer generated answers you might get from a system like ChatGPT, but because they were carefully written by a human, they are more predictable and trustworthy than a generated answer. This makes them a great choice for academic situations where accuracy is important or for business situations where there may be legal consequences to the computer giving a wrong answer.
                    </p>
					<p class="typographic-paragraph">
						In other words, RASA uses AI to <strong>flexibly understand</strong> what you say to it, and then relies on human designed answers to provide <strong>predictable responses</strong>.
