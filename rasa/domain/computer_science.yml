  utter_talk_about_computer_science:
  - text: "While there is no official definition of Computer Science one way to view it is as the study of computation. This includes the study of:

 - What can and cannot be solved through step by step processes called algorithms

 - How to calculate and improve the efficiency of computing processes

 - How computer science impacts more practical issues like hardware or software design
  
   Why are you interested in computer science?"

  utter_cs_interest_programming:
  - text: "There's more to computer science than just writing programs, but it can definitely help you become a better programmer. 
  
  Would you like to hear about some of our best programming related classes?"
  
  utter_cs_interest_games:
  - text: "A lot of people get interested in computers through gaming.
  
  Games are complex programming projects, so taking classes on software engineering will help prepare you for industry. Studying algorithms and computer architecture will also help you create more efficient game code.
  
  Would you like to hear about some related classes?"
  
  utter_cs_interest_hacking:
  - text: "Computer security is more important than ever these days and computer science can give you the tools you need to outsmart hackers or even to do a little reverse engineering of your own.
  
  Would you like to hear about some security related courses?"
  
  utter_cs_interest_ai:
  - text: "Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and data science have all become big business these days. I'm actually partially powered by machine learning myself!
  
  Would you like to hear about some of the AI related courses you can take at UF?"
  
  utter_cs_interest_fallback:
  - text: "I see. Most people get interested in computer science because they want to work as programmers. Others want to be researchers or even hackers.
  
  Are you interested in hearing about some of the topics that computer science covers?"
  
  utter_cs_disengage:
  - text: "Ok. Do you have any other questions about computer science or the University of Florida?"
  
  utter_cs_generic_prompt:
  - text: "Great! Would you like to talk about the University of Florida or talk more about computer science?"
  
  utter_cs_trivia:
  - text: "The first program ever was written by the mathematician Ada Lovelace"
  - text: "You technically don't need a computer to do computer science. A lot of important analysis work can be done using nothing but pure math and your brain."
  - text: "An 'algorithm' is a step by step process to solve a computing problem and is named after the ancient Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi"
