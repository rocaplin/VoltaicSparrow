  utter_faq/ufonline:
  - text: "Online classes are convenient and economical. UF Online is one of the top programs in the United States and offers many degrees online.
  
The challenges of online study can include power outages, technical difficulties, and distractions. Proactive and disciplined students will be most successful.

If you would like to find out more about UF Online, visit https://ufonline.ufl.edu."

  utter_faq/ufcampus:
  - text: "Campus classes provide a more traditional college experience. The University of Florida offers a wide variety of degree programs, facilities, and extracurricular opportunities.

 The challenges of campus study can include a daily commute, new living arrangements, and distractions. Proactive and disciplined students will be most successful.

  utter_which_college:
  - text: "Which college are you interested in pursuing computer science in? There are two: the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering."
  
  utter_difference:
  - text: "Some things change when you pursue a computer science degree in one college versus the other. The difference between the two lies mostly in the courses you will be taking. Additionally, there may be some college requirements that will differ depending on the choice you make."
  
  utter_required_courses_eng:
  - text: "There are a number of courses that you will be taking as a computer science student in the College of Engineering. All students are required to take six critical tracking courses: MAC 2311 Analytic Geometry and Calculus 1, MAC 2312 Analytic Geometry and Calculus 2, MAC 2313 Analytic Geometry and Calculus 3, COP3502C Programming Fundamentals 1, PHY 2048 Physics with Calculus 1, and PHY 2049 Physics with Calculus 2. 
 
 Some additional courses you can expect to be taking include COP 3503C Programming Fundamentals 2, COT 3100 Applications of Discrete Structures, COP 3530 Data Structures and Algorithm, COP 4600 Operating Systems, and COP 4020 Programming Language Concepts.

  utter_faq/credit_hours:
  - text: "A Computer Science Degree at UF requires a minimum of 120 total credit hours. For a full-time student, this constitutes 12-18 credit hours per semester. This is usually 4-6 classes per semester, depending on individual course credits."

  utter_faq/excess_hours:
  - text: "Computer Science has a credit limit of 120 hours for both the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering. For more information, refer to this page: https://registrar.ufl.edu/courses/excess-hours."

  utter_faq/workload_per_hour:
  - text: "Each credit hour is defined as one hour of in-person instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class work per week. A 15-credit semester would consist of 15 hours of in-person instruction, and 30 hours of out-of-class work per week."

  utter_faq/csdefinition:
  - text: "While there is no official definition of Computer Science one way to view it is as the study of computation. This includes the study of:

 - what can and cannot be solved through computation.

 - computational methods and their application.

 - the tools we use to perform computations."

  utter_modern_computers:
  - text: "The first general purpose computers began to be built in the United States and Europe during the late 1930s. The term Computer Science was coined in the 1950s to describe related coursework being offered by universities."

  utter_csetymology:
  - text: "The development of modern computers took place over a period of centuries drawing from a number of fields in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering, and as a result the topics addressed by these courses were just as broad. While the academic field of Computer Science is relatively young it has expanded rapidly and had far reaching societal impacts.

It is likely that for all of these reasons, there are a variety of perspectives on what constitutes Computer Science, and how it should be defined."
